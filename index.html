    <h2>Biography</h2>

    <p>Hello, my name is Eileen Velez Tyler. I was born and raised in San Diego CA.
       I am currently stationed in Lemoore CA. I am married to my amazing husband and
       recently had a baby boy. Next year will mark my third year being enlisted in the 
       navy. I enjoy spending time with my family, reading, playing video games and sometimes
       cooking. I am looking forward to learning about coding as it has recently acquired my 
       interest.
